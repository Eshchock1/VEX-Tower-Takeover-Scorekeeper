## About the program
The program takes live input for cubes stacked in goalzones for both blue and red alliances, as well as cubes placed in towers during the match.  
  
The program not only displays live score, but also makes game play recommendations for placing certain coloured cubes in towers, and removing certain coloured cubes from towers to maximize the point difference between alliances.  
  
The program can also be used to calculate final scores of matches before announced by the judges.
